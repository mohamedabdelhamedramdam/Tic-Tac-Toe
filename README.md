# Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game repository! This project is a simple and interactive implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.

## Features
- Responsive Design: The game board adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Dynamic Gameplay: Player turns are automatically managed, displaying "X" and "O" alternatively.
- Winning Detection: The game instantly detects winning combinations and announces the winner.
- Reset Functionality: A reset button allows for a quick restart, resetting the game board and scores.
- Accessible and User-Friendly: Cells are focusable, providing better accessibility, and the user interface is intuitive.
## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure of the game layout.
- CSS: Styling for the game board and user interface.
- JavaScript: Logic for gameplay, including player moves, win detection, and game reset functionality.
